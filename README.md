## üìù Project Description

The **Password Manager Bot** is a simple and secure desktop application developed in Python, utilizing `Tkinter` for the graphical user interface and `SQLite` for data storage. It allows users to **efficiently manage their passwords**:

* **User Registration and Login:** Each user has their own secure account protected by a hashed password (SHA256).
* **Strong Password Generation:** Generate random and customizable passwords, choosing the length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols).
* **Password Storage:** Save generated passwords with an associated description (e.g., "Password for Spotify," "Bank Login") for easy retrieval.
* **View Saved Passwords:** Access and view all the passwords you've generated and stored in your account.

**Goal:** To provide a practical tool for creating and organizing robust passwords, promoting better digital security practices.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User authentication system** (registration and login).
* Password generation with configurable criteria (length, character types).
* **Saving generated passwords** with a useful description.
* Listing of all stored passwords for the logged-in user.
* Intuitive graphical interface based on `Tkinter`.
* Persistent data storage using `SQLite3`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Tkinter:** Python's standard library for creating graphical interfaces.
* **SQLite3:** A lightweight, embedded database, ideal for desktop applications.
* **hashlib:** Module for hashing user passwords (SHA256).

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Follow the steps below to get the Password Manager Bot up and running on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/password-manager-bot.git](https://github.com/your-username/password-manager-bot.git)
    # If you manually downloaded the files, skip this step.
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd password-manager-bot
    ```
    (Or `cd` to the folder where you saved the files: `app.py`, `database.py`, `password_generator.py`)

3.  There are **no external dependencies** beyond Python's standard libraries, so you don't need `pip install`.

### Execution

1.  From the project's root directory, run the main file:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  The Password Manager Bot application window will open.
